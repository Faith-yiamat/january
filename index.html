    <p>
        My name is faith yiamat and i am a software developer from the united states 
        of america. I have been interested with <br> coding since my early childhood when 
        I was given my first computer by the parents as a gift. At that time i started
        learning programing languages like basic and pascal which are easy to understand.
        <br> After some years i learnt C++  which is the most powerful language in my
        opinion because it allows you to do everything that can be done in other languages
        but also gives you an ability to interact directly with hardware. <br>Then  came java 
        which opened up new world with me. Java allows me to create applications. I observed
        that many people were creating simple games and networking sites so i decided
        to join them too. Learning more things from them.
